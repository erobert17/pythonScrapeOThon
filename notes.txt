- name (main name of product)
- product_url (link to the product page)
- price (price of product / if discounted, the un-discounted price)
- sku (the product sku if it exists, otherwise the full product name, lowercase with underscores connecting words)
- image_url (the url to the raw product image)


Do you have everything you need to get started on these first 5?
A couple additional recommendations would be:
- start a fresh github repo to push your scrapper code 
- please separate the code for each site into a separate script / jupyter notebook
- add an additional column to the csv called "username" where you simply repeat the brand name for each row
- label the output csv <username>.csv for each brand
